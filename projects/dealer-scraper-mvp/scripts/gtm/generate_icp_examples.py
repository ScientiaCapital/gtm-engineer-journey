## Real Contractor Examples with Multi-Dimensional Scoring

**Purpose**: Help Pakistan GTM team understand lead prioritization and messaging

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25

---

## ICP SCORING DIMENSIONS (0-100 Total)

**Year 1 GTM-Aligned Weights**: Targeting $5-10M contractors scaling to $50-100M (50-100 employees) - the blue ocean between residential-only tools and enterprise platforms (ServiceTitan/Procore target 100+ employees).

Our lead scoring is multi-dimensional, not a simple yes/no filter. Each dimension captures a different aspect of ideal customer fit:

### 1. Resimercial Mix (35 points maximum - HIGHEST WEIGHT)
**What it measures**: Does the contractor do BOTH residential AND commercial work?

**Why it matters**:
- Pure residential contractors = homeowner mindset (price-sensitive, small projects)
- Pure commercial (100+ employees) = ServiceTitan/Procore territory, utility/industrial focus
- **Resimercial contractors (50-100 employees) = Coperniq's blue ocean**: Too sophisticated for residential tools, too small for enterprise platforms
- Scaling businesses ($5-10M ‚Üí $50-100M) need platform solutions NOW

**Scoring**:
- Has both residential AND commercial = 35 pts
- Primarily commercial with some residential = 25 pts
- Primarily residential with some commercial = 20 pts
- Single-category only = 0 pts

**Coperniq's Advantage**: ServiceTitan/Procore don't scale down to resimercial easily. This is our market.

---

### 2. Multi-OEM Presence (25 points maximum - CORE PAIN POINT)
**What it measures**: How many OEM brand certifications does the contractor have?

**Why it matters**:
- **This is the pain point we solve**: Managing multiple monitoring platforms
- Single-OEM contractor = uses one platform (no pain)
- Multi-OEM contractor = juggling 3-4+ platforms daily (high pain)
- Also signals sophistication: investment in multiple certifications

**Scoring**:
- 4+ OEM brands = 25 pts (maximum pain, highest value)
- 3 OEM brands = 20 pts
- 2 OEM brands = 15 pts
- 1 OEM brand = 8 pts

**Common multi-OEM combinations**:
- Generac + Tesla + Enphase (generator + battery + solar)
- Generac + SolarEdge + Fronius (generator + inverters)
- Tesla + Enphase + Briggs & Stratton (battery + solar + backup)

---

### 3. MEP+R Self-Performing (25 points maximum - PLATFORM POWER USERS)
**What it measures**: Does the contractor perform multiple trades in-house (mechanical, electrical, plumbing + renewables)?

**Why it matters**:
- Multi-trade = larger, more sophisticated business (50-100 employees)
- Self-performing = control over entire installation (not subbing out)
- MEP background = understands building systems holistically
- **Platform adopters**: Will use monitoring ‚Üí scheduling/dispatch ‚Üí white-labeled portal ‚Üí mobile app
- Blue ocean contractors currently ignored by big enterprise tools

**Scoring**:
- 3+ trades self-performed = 25 pts (full platform power user)
- 2 trades self-performed = 18 pts
- Single trade specialist = 8 pts

**Target Profile**: 25 office staff + 50-75 field techs = perfect for Coperniq platform adoption

---

### 4. O&M Revenue Streams (15 points maximum - BONUS)
**What it measures**: Does the contractor have ongoing operations & maintenance contracts?

**Why it matters (Year 2 focus)**:
- Install-only contractors = one-time transaction, move to next job
- **O&M contractors = recurring revenue model**: Platform features maturing in Year 2
- Year 1: Monitoring + scheduling/dispatch prioritized
- Year 2: Full O&M platform suite (service agreements, preventive maintenance)

**Scoring**:
- Has dedicated O&M division/service contracts = 15 pts
- Offers maintenance services (not structured O&M) = 10 pts
- Install-only (no maintenance) = 0 pts

**Red flags for O&M presence**:
- "24/7 monitoring" in website copy
- "Service agreements" or "maintenance plans" mentioned
- "Emergency service" or "preventive maintenance"
- Larger team size (50+ employees)

---

## PLATINUM TIER EXAMPLE (ICP Score: 92/100)

### Company Profile
**Name**: SunPower Electric & Energy Solutions
**Location**: Houston, TX 77019
**Phone**: (713) 555-0123
**Website**: sunpowerelectrichouston.com
**Employees**: 45-50 (estimated)

### OEM Certifications
‚úÖ Generac Premier Dealer
‚úÖ Tesla Powerwall Certified Installer
‚úÖ Enphase Platinum Installer
‚úÖ Fronius Service Partner

**Multi-OEM Score: 20/20** ‚Üê Managing 4 platforms daily!

---

### ICP Scoring Breakdown (Year 1 GTM-Aligned Weights)

#### 1. Resimercial Mix: 35/35 ‚Üê HIGHEST VALUE (Coperniq's Blue Ocean)
**Evidence**:
- Website sections for "Commercial Solar" AND "Residential Backup Power"
- Portfolio shows multifamily buildings + single-family homes
- Services listed: "Industrial solar arrays, commercial battery storage, residential backup systems"
- Estimated 50-75 employees (25 office + 50 techs)

**Why 35/35**: Perfect resimercial contractor! Too sophisticated for residential-only tools, too small for ServiceTitan (wants 100+ employees). This contractor is scaling from $5-10M to $50-100M and needs Coperniq's platform NOW. **This is Coperniq's blue ocean market that enterprise tools ignore.**

---

#### 2. Multi-OEM Presence: 25/25 ‚Üê CORE PAIN POINT
**Evidence**: Certified with 4 OEM brands (see above)

**Why 25/25**: Managing 4 separate monitoring platforms:
- Generac Mobile Link (generators)
- Tesla app (Powerwall batteries)
- Enphase Enlighten (microinverters)
- Fronius Solar.web (string inverters)

**Pain point intensity**: Extreme. Service techs are logging into 4 different platforms, learning 4 different UIs, explaining 4 different customer portals. **Coperniq solves this exact problem.**

---

#### 3. MEP+R Self-Performing: 18/25
**Evidence**:
- Electrical contractor background (licensed electrician)
- Renewables focus (solar + battery + generator)
- Some HVAC integration capability
- 2 trades evident (electrical + energy systems)

**Why 18/25**: Self-performing electrical + renewables contractor. Not full MEP (missing plumbing/mechanical divisions), but sophisticated enough to adopt platform features. Will use monitoring ‚Üí scheduling/dispatch ‚Üí white-labeled portal as features launch.

---

#### 4. O&M Services: 15/15 ‚Üê BONUS (Year 2 Platform Focus)
**Evidence**:
- Website page: "Maintenance Plans & Monitoring"
- Copy: "24/7 remote monitoring + annual preventive maintenance contracts"
- Services: "Emergency generator service," "Battery health checks," "Solar panel cleaning & inspection"
- Team page shows "Service Manager" role

**Why 15/15**: Full O&M bonus! This contractor already has recurring revenue model. When Coperniq launches full O&M platform suite (Year 2), they'll be perfect power users.

---

### Total ICP Score: 93/100 (PLATINUM)

**Priority**: **CALL FIRST** - Top 10% of all leads

**Pain Point Summary**:
1. Managing 4 monitoring platforms for O&M customers
2. Service techs losing time switching between apps
3. Customer confusion ("Which app do I use?")
4. Missed alerts across platforms
5. Difficult to provide unified customer experience

**GTM Messaging**:
- Subject: "Managing 4+ monitoring platforms for your service contracts?"
- Pain: "Your service techs are logging into Generac, Tesla, Enphase, and Fronius separately every day"
- Solution: "Coperniq: One unified dashboard for all your O&M customers"
- CTA: "See how we save 2-3 hours/day for contractors managing 100+ service agreements"

**Expected Conversion**: High (40-50% demo-to-close)

---

## GOLD TIER EXAMPLE (ICP Score: 68/100)

### Company Profile
**Name**: Coastal Solar & Battery Solutions
**Location**: San Diego, CA 92037
**Phone**: (619) 555-0456
**Website**: coastalsolarbattery.com
**Employees**: 12-15 (estimated)

### OEM Certifications
‚úÖ Tesla Powerwall Certified Installer
‚úÖ Enphase Gold Installer

**Multi-OEM Score: 12/20** ‚Üê Managing 2 platforms

---

### ICP Scoring Breakdown (Year 1 GTM-Aligned Weights)

#### 1. Resimercial Mix: 25/35
**Evidence**:
- Website focus: "Residential Solar & Battery Storage"
- BUT: Portfolio section shows "Small commercial projects (under 100kW)"
- Services: "Home solar installation, small business solar, battery backup"
- Estimated 30-40 employees (15 office + 25 techs)

**Why 25/35**: Primarily residential with some small commercial. Not pure resimercial (which would be 35/35), but diverse enough to be valuable. Still in Coperniq's sweet spot (too small for ServiceTitan at 100+ employees). Scaling from $3-5M ‚Üí $10-15M range.

---

#### 2. Multi-OEM Presence: 15/25
**Evidence**: Certified with 2 OEM brands (Tesla + Enphase)

**Why 15/25**: Managing 2 platforms:
- Tesla app (batteries)
- Enphase Enlighten (solar microinverters)

**Pain point intensity**: Moderate. Less pain than 4-platform contractors, but still juggling two separate logins, two UIs, two customer portals. **Coperniq still provides value**, but not as critical as PLATINUM tier.

---

#### 3. MEP+R Self-Performing: 18/25
**Evidence**:
- Website mentions "Licensed electrical contractors"
- Services: "Solar installation + Electrical service upgrades"
- 2 trades evident (electrical + solar/renewables)
- Some HVAC integration mentioned

**Why 18/25**: Self-performing electrical + renewables contractor. Not full MEP, but sophisticated enough for platform adoption. Will use monitoring + scheduling/dispatch in Year 1.

---

#### 4. O&M Services: 10/15
**Evidence**:
- Website page: "Warranty & Maintenance Services"
- Copy: "Annual system checkups, cleaning, troubleshooting"
- Service offering exists but NOT structured as recurring O&M contracts
- No "24/7 monitoring" or "service agreements" mentioned

**Why 10/15**: Offers maintenance services but NOT structured O&M division. This is reactive service (customer calls when there's a problem) rather than proactive monitoring. Good candidate for Year 2 O&M platform features.

---

### Total ICP Score: 68/100 (GOLD)

**Priority**: **HIGH PRIORITY** - Top 30% of all leads

**Pain Point Summary**:
1. Managing 2 monitoring platforms (Tesla + Enphase)
2. Customer confusion about which app to use
3. Reactive maintenance (not proactive O&M)
4. Some commercial work (needs professional dashboard)

**GTM Messaging**:
- Subject: "One dashboard for Tesla + Enphase monitoring?"
- Pain: "Switching between Tesla app and Enphase Enlighten for every customer check-in"
- Solution: "Coperniq: Unified monitoring for battery + solar in one view"
- CTA: "See 15-min demo - perfect for contractors doing 50+ installs/year"

**Expected Conversion**: Medium-High (25-35% demo-to-close)

---

## TIER COMPARISON SUMMARY (Year 1 GTM-Aligned Weights)

| Dimension | PLATINUM (93/100) | GOLD (68/100) | Difference | Weight |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| **Resimercial** | 35/35 (Perfect resimercial) | 25/35 (Primarily resi) | +10 | **35%** ‚Üê HIGHEST |
| **Multi-OEM** | 25/25 (4 brands) | 15/25 (2 brands) | +10 | **25%** |
| **MEP+R** | 18/25 (2 trades) | 18/25 (2 trades) | 0 | **25%** |
| **O&M Services** | 15/15 (Full O&M) | 10/15 (Reactive) | +5 | **15%** |
| **TOTAL** | **93/100** | **68/100** | **+25** | **100%** |

**Key Insight**: PLATINUM tier excels in Resimercial (35 pts) and Multi-OEM (25 pts) - the two dimensions that define Coperniq's blue ocean market. Both tiers have similar MEP+R sophistication (18 pts), confirming these are platform-ready contractors.
