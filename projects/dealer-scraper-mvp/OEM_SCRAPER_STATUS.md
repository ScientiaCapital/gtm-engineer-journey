## üìà MULTI-OEM VALUE PROPOSITION

**Why Multi-OEM Cross-Reference Matters**:

Contractors certified with 2-4 OEM brands are:
- Managing 2-4 separate monitoring platforms (PAIN POINT)
- More sophisticated businesses (investment in certifications)
- Larger customer bases (broader market reach)
- Higher revenue ($1M-$10M+ for multi-OEM commercial)
- **Perfect ICP for Coperniq's unified monitoring platform**

**Expected Multi-OEM Overlap** (once all scrapers running):
- Generac + Tesla + Enphase: Whole-home energy contractors
- Generac + SMA: Commercial backup power specialists
- Fronius + Sol-Ark + SimpliPhi: Battery integration experts
- Briggs + Kohler + Cummins: Multi-brand generator dealers

**ICP Scoring Impact**:
- 1 OEM: 25 points (base)
- 2 OEMs: 50 points (multi-brand pain)
- 3 OEMs: 75 points (high sophistication)
- 4+ OEMs: 100 points (PLATINUM tier)
