## Site Quirks & Special Handling

### Fronius
- **Language/Region**: Uses Sitecore CMS with language/region routing (`/en-us/usa/`)
- **Component-based**: PartnerSearch component with dataSource GUID (client-side rendering)
- **Partner Tiers**: Two levels (Solutions Partner, Solutions Partner Plus)
- **No Ratings**: Locator doesn't display ratings/reviews
- **Austrian Company**: May have different naming conventions (e.g., "Solutions Partner" vs "Certified Installer")

### Sol-Ark
- **Featured Section**: "Top Distributors" prominently displayed before map
  - Extraction script prioritizes these featured distributors
- **Distributor vs Installer**: Sol-Ark uses "distributor" terminology (wholesale partners)
  - Distributors may not do installations themselves but supply installers
- **100% Battery-Capable**: All Sol-Ark products are hybrid inverters with battery integration
  - `has_battery = True` for all results
- **Plano, TX Based**: U.S. company (not international localization concerns)

### SimpliPhi (Briggs & Stratton)
- **Brand Transition**: SimpliPhi Power acquired by Briggs & Stratton (2021)
  - URLs now redirect to `energy.briggsandstratton.com` domain
  - Old `simpliphipower.com` URLs may redirect
- **Product Filter Required**: Must select "Battery Energy Storage" checkbox
  - Page also shows "Standby Generators" dealers (different product line)
- **Multi-Product Opportunity**: Dealers offering BOTH generators + batteries = premium targets
  - Extraction script flags `is_multi_product` for these dealers
- **No Ratings**: Dealer locator doesn't display ratings/reviews

## Multi-OEM Cross-Reference Opportunities

### High-Value Multi-OEM Scenarios

1. **Sol-Ark + Generac**
   - Both focus on backup power and resilience
   - Sol-Ark hybrid inverters + Generac generators = complete backup solution
   - Distributors likely carry both brands

2. **SimpliPhi + Tesla + Enphase**
   - SimpliPhi batteries are brand-agnostic (work with any inverter)
   - Contractors may offer SimpliPhi as alternative to Tesla Powerwall
   - Multi-battery brand capability = sophisticated installer

3. **Fronius + SolarEdge**
   - Both are string inverter brands (compete for commercial projects)
   - Dual certification = large commercial capability
   - Installer can quote either brand based on project needs

4. **Sol-Ark + SimpliPhi**
   - Sol-Ark hybrid inverters pair well with SimpliPhi LFP batteries
   - Both focus on resilience and off-grid applications
   - Overlap = premium energy independence contractors

### Triple-Threat Contractors (Highest Value)
- **Generac + Sol-Ark + SimpliPhi** = Backup power specialists (generator + hybrid + battery)
- **Fronius + Tesla + Enphase** = Multi-inverter brand capability (string + micro + battery)
- **SolarEdge + Fronius + SimpliPhi** = Commercial solar + storage specialists

## Testing the Scrapers

### PLAYWRIGHT Mode (Manual Testing)

```python
from scrapers.fronius_scraper import FroniusScraper
from scrapers.solark_scraper import SolArkScraper
from scrapers.simpliphi_scraper import SimpliPhiScraper
from scrapers.base_scraper import ScraperMode

# Test Fronius
fronius = FroniusScraper(mode=ScraperMode.PLAYWRIGHT)
fronius.scrape_zip_code("94102")  # Prints manual MCP workflow

# Test Sol-Ark
solark = SolArkScraper(mode=ScraperMode.PLAYWRIGHT)
solark.scrape_zip_code("94102")

# Test SimpliPhi
simpliphi = SimpliPhiScraper(mode=ScraperMode.PLAYWRIGHT)
simpliphi.scrape_zip_code("94102")
```

Follow the printed MCP Playwright instructions to manually execute the workflow and verify extraction scripts.

### Factory Usage

```python
from scrapers.scraper_factory import ScraperFactory
from scrapers.base_scraper import ScraperMode

# Create scrapers by name
fronius = ScraperFactory.create("Fronius", mode=ScraperMode.RUNPOD)
solark = ScraperFactory.create("Sol-Ark", mode=ScraperMode.RUNPOD)
simpliphi = ScraperFactory.create("SimpliPhi", mode=ScraperMode.RUNPOD)

# Or get all scrapers
all_scrapers = ScraperFactory.create_all(mode=ScraperMode.RUNPOD)
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Manual Testing (PLAYWRIGHT Mode)
- [ ] Test Fronius scraper with real ZIP code
  - Verify PartnerSearch component loads
  - Confirm extraction script captures partner details
  - Validate tier detection (Partner vs. Partner Plus)

- [ ] Test Sol-Ark scraper with real ZIP code
  - Verify distributor map loads
  - Confirm featured "Top Distributors" section captured
  - Validate 100% battery capability flag

- [ ] Test SimpliPhi scraper with real ZIP code
  - Verify Briggs & Stratton dealer locator loads
  - Confirm "Battery Energy Storage" filter works
  - Validate multi-product detection (generators + batteries)

### 2. Extraction Script Refinement
- Adjust CSS selectors based on actual site inspection
- Fine-tune address parsing logic
- Validate phone number extraction
- Test edge cases (dealers with missing fields)

### 3. RUNPOD Mode Testing
- Add RunPod API credentials to `.env`
- Test automated scraping workflow
- Verify JSON response parsing
- Measure performance (should be ~5-6s per ZIP)

### 4. Multi-OEM Cross-Reference
- Run all scrapers across SREC state ZIPs
- Execute `MultiOEMDetector` to find cross-certified contractors
- Analyze multi-OEM patterns:
  - Fronius + SolarEdge = commercial string inverter expertise
  - Sol-Ark + Generac = backup power specialists
  - SimpliPhi + Tesla = multi-battery brand capability

### 5. Integration with Lead Generation
- Update `scripts/generate_leads.py` to include new scrapers
- Add CLI flags: `--oems Fronius,Sol-Ark,SimpliPhi`
- Update Coperniq scoring to prioritize:
  - Battery-focused contractors (Sol-Ark, SimpliPhi)
  - Multi-inverter brand capability (Fronius + SolarEdge)
  - Multi-product dealers (generators + solar + batteries)

## Strategic Insights

### Why These OEMs Matter for Coperniq

1. **Fronius (String Inverters + Hybrid)**
   - **Market**: Commercial solar + hybrid residential
   - **Coperniq Fit**: GEN24 Plus hybrid systems need multi-brand monitoring
   - **Lead Quality**: Partner Plus tier = sophisticated contractors
   - **Multi-OEM Probability**: HIGH (often certified with SolarEdge, Enphase)

2. **Sol-Ark (Hybrid Inverters + Battery)**
   - **Market**: Off-grid, backup power, resilience
   - **Coperniq Fit**: 100% battery-integrated systems (core monitoring use case)
   - **Lead Quality**: Premium distributors with energy storage expertise
   - **Multi-OEM Probability**: VERY HIGH (carry multiple brands for resilience solutions)

3. **SimpliPhi (LFP Batteries)**
   - **Market**: Brand-agnostic battery storage
   - **Coperniq Fit**: Works with any inverter brand (perfect for Coperniq's platform)
   - **Lead Quality**: Multi-product dealers (Briggs generators + batteries) = premium
   - **Multi-OEM Probability**: EXTREMELY HIGH (brand-agnostic = multi-brand by definition)

### Expected Multi-OEM Overlap

Based on product categories and market positioning:
- **70-80%** of Sol-Ark distributors likely carry other brands (Generac, Enphase, etc.)
- **60-70%** of SimpliPhi installers work with multiple inverter/battery brands
- **50-60%** of Fronius installers also certified with SolarEdge or Enphase

Running cross-reference analysis will reveal the actual overlap and identify the highest-value prospects.
