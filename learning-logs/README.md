# Learning Logs

Personal reflections and weekly notes documenting the journey from GTM executive to builder.

## Structure

```
2025/
├── october/     # Foundation month - Docker, APIs, first production tools
└── november/    # [Current month]
```

## Purpose

This folder captures:
- Weekly learning reflections
- Technical challenges and breakthroughs
- What worked, what didn't
- Questions that emerged
- Resources discovered

These are **personal notes** - raw, unpolished, honest documentation of the learning process.

## Usage

Add weekly markdown files as you learn:
- `week-01-docker-fundamentals.md`
- `week-02-dealer-scraper-build.md`
- `week-03-voice-agent-architecture.md`

Keep it simple. This is for you, not an audience.
