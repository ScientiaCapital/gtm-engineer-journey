## 📖 Project Description

GTM Engineer Journey is a public portfolio documenting a 25+ year sales and business development executive's transition into engineering. The project showcases the development of production-ready Go-To-Market (GTM) tools while transparently sharing the learning process.

The repository serves as both a codebase for active AI/ML projects and a living case study of skill transformation from enterprise system implementation to building technical solutions. Current flagship project is a voice agent for SDR work designed to 10x sales development representative productivity through ultra-low latency conversational AI.

---

## 🚧 Current Blockers

**None Reported** - Project in active development phase
*Note: Monitor for technical challenges with real-time voice streaming integration*

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Voice Agent Core Integration** - Connect Cartesia voice synthesis with Cerebras inference pipeline
2. **WebSocket Implementation** - Set up real-time audio streaming between frontend and backend
3. **Latency Testing** - Begin benchmarking to achieve < 100ms response target

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
4. **SDR Workflow Integration** - Map AI agent to actual sales development representative call patterns
5. **Error Handling** - Implement robust error recovery for voice streaming interruptions

### Ongoing
6. **Portfolio Updates** - Continue documenting engineering journey progress
7. **Dealer Scraper Maintenance** - Ensure live MVP continues processing data reliably
