# GTM Engineer Journey 🚀

**Live Portfolio:** [scientiacapital.github.io/gtm-engineer-journey](https://scientiacapital.github.io/gtm-engineer-journey)

> From boardroom to codebase: 25+ years in sales & business development → 90 days shipping production code.

Building production-ready GTM tools while documenting the journey in public.

## 🎯 About This Journey

After **25+ years** implementing enterprise systems (Five9, Service Titan, CRMs) and holding technical certifications (Generac, Enphase, SimpliPhi, Series 7/63), I had a realization:

**I was always on the buying side of GTM tools. What if I could build them?**

This repository documents my learning journey from executive to engineer - building real tools that solve real GTM problems I've experienced in the field.

**Current Status:**
- 📅 **Day 90** of learning to build
- 💼 **Sr. BDR @ Coperniq** (still crushing quota)
- 🏗️ **Building nights & weekends**
- 📊 **4 active projects** (1 live, 3 in development)
- 🎙️ **NEW:** Building voice agents with Cartesia + Cerebras

## 🔥 Production Tools

### 🎙️ Voice Agent for SDR Work (Building Now)
**Status:** 🔬 EXPLORING - Building with cutting-edge AI
**Tech Stack:** Cartesia (ultra-realistic voice), Cerebras (ultra-fast inference), FastAPI, WebSockets, Claude
**Goal:** 10x SDR productivity with < 100ms latency
**Why I'm Building It:** "Making 50+ calls daily taught me exactly what AI should automate. Building the 10x agent I wish existed."

**What I'm Learning:**
- Real-time conversational AI at scale
- Ultra-low latency voice synthesis (Cartesia)
- High-speed LLM inference (Cerebras)
- WebSocket architectures for voice streaming
- Production voice agent deployment

### [Dealer Scraper MVP](./projects/dealer-scraper-mvp)
**Status:** ✅ LIVE - Processing real data
**Tech Stack:** Python, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Docker
**Results:** 1,247+ dealers scraped, 99.2% success rate
**Why I Built It:** "When I was selling solar, I needed this exact tool. So I built it."

**What I Learned:**
- Web scraping at scale
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Production-ready error handling
- Docker containerization

## 🎓 The Learning Philosophy

**I've never been afraid to start from the bottom to learn something new.**

- **2000s:** Serial Entrepreneur (Bio/Nanotech, raised angel capital)
- **2010s:** Director Roles (Call centers, GTM teams, enterprise implementations)
- **2018-2020:** Reset to IC (HVAC/Solar lead gen → in-home sales)
- **2023-Present:** First GTM Hire @ Coperniq (0→1 startup)
- **2021:** Berkeley Fintech Python Bootcamp
- **2021-2025:** Deep dive into ML, AI, Crypto, Blockchain
- **2025:** Started building production tools

**Key Insight:** "I've been the customer for every GTM tool. I know where they fail because I've lived it. Now I'm learning why they fail by building them myself."

## 🌟 What Makes This Different

### Most Engineers Have:
- ✅ Deep technical skills
- ✅ Strong CS foundation
- ❌ Don't understand GTM workflows
- ❌ Haven't sold to enterprises

### Most GTM Leaders Have:
- ✅ Deep customer empathy
- ✅ Sales & business experience
- ❌ Can't read the codebase
- ❌ Don't understand architecture

### What I'm Building:
- ✅ 25 years experiencing GTM pain points
- ✅ 6 enterprise tool implementations (buyer perspective)
- ✅ Technical certifications (can understand complex systems)
- ✅ Now learning to build the solutions
- ✅ Understanding both sides

**Books That Shaped My Thinking:**
Business Model Generation • Crossing the Chasm • Blue Ocean Strategy • Challenger Sale • Never Split the Difference • Jobs to be Done

## 💭 The Bigger Picture

I believe the next generation of GTM tools will be AI-native. Not chatbots bolted onto CRMs. Not automation that breaks. But genuinely intelligent systems that understand context, learn from interactions, and actually help salespeople sell better.

**I've spent:**
- 25 years using GTM tools
- 5 years following AI/ML
- 90 days building production systems

This journey is about understanding both sides deeply enough to build something that doesn't suck.
